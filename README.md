Player Tracker
==============
This program is to be written in Java. It is my capstone project for my senior year at Cuyahoga Valley Career Center (2013-2014).

The application will include both a client- and server-side. The idea of the program is to help game and forum administrators keep track of players, their actions, wrongdoings, and the like. For data storage, a MySQL database will be used, along with a Maven build system. JUnit will also be used for unit testing.
